# Sales Pipeline & Forecast Accuracy Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes CRM-style sales pipeline data to evaluate forecast accuracy, pipeline health, and deal progression. The goal is to demonstrate practical sales operations and data analysis skills using SQL queries and Power BI data visualization.

## Business Questions
- How does actual revenue compare to forecasted revenue over time?
- Which pipeline stages contribute most to forecast inaccuracy?
- Where are deals stalling in the pipeline?
- What changes could improve forecast accuracy and decision-making?

## Tools Used
- Power BI (dashboard development, KPI reporting)
- SQL (basic queries, joins, aggregations)
- Excel / Power Query (data cleaning and preparation)

## Key Insights
- Late-stage opportunities drive the majority of forecast variance.
- Stalled deals exceeding 45 days correlate with reduced forecast accuracy.
- Certain pipeline stages show high volume but below-average win rates.

## Recommendations
- Standardize stage exit criteria for late-stage opportunities.
- Flag stalled deals for weekly review.
- Improve pipeline hygiene by enforcing close-date updates.
